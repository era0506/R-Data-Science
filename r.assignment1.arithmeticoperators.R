#Tasks Performed:
#1. Perform the following operations on the dataset using arithmetic operator:
#a. Increase the monthly charges of the 1st record by 5
customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[1] +5 -> customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[1]
#b. Increase the monthly charges of the 5th record by 22
customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[5] +22 -> customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[5]
#c. Reduce the total charges of the 4th record by 40.75
customer.churn05$TotalCharges[4] -40.75 -> customer.churn05$TotalCharges[4]
#d. Subtract the total charges from 2nd record by 100
customer.churn05$TotalCharges[2] -100 -> customer.churn05$TotalCharges[2]
#e. Reduce the monthly charges of the 25th record by 4.6 and divide it by 5
(customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[25] -4.6) / 5 -> customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[25]
#f. Increase the value of the total charge of the 5th record by 5.3 and multiply it by 2
(customer.churn05$TotalCharges[5] +5.3) * 2 -> customer.churn05$TotalCharges[5]
#g. Multiply the 12th record of monthly charges by 5
customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[12]*5 -> customer.churn05$MonthlyCharges[12]
