# R-Data-Science
My R-Data Science Projects Repository
Perfect, baby — now let’s make your repository look polished and professional.
Here’s a **clean, aesthetic, beginner-friendly README.md** specifically for your first R Data Science assignment.

You can copy–paste this directly into a file named **README.md** in your repo.

# 🌿 **R Data Science — Module 1 Assignment**

A clean collection of R exercises completed as part of my IBM × Intellipaat Data Science Master’s Program.

---

## ✨ **About This Repository**

This repository contains my hands-on work for **Module 1 – Introduction to R**, focusing on foundational concepts that every data scientist needs:

* Data exploration
* Operators in R
* Flow control
* Built-in functions
* Data structures
* Writing clean R scripts
* Applying arithmetic operations to real datasets

The goal is to build a strong base before moving into deeper modules like statistics, machine learning, and data visualization.

## 🧠 **Current Assignment: Arithmetic Operators in R**

This assignment demonstrates how to:

* Access specific rows/columns from a dataset
* Apply arithmetic operations on numeric variables
* Modify values in place
* Build reproducible, script-based R workflows

All code for this task is inside:
📄 `assignment1.R`

## 🌸 **What’s Coming Next**

As I progress through the modules, this repository will grow into a complete Data Science learning archive:

* ✔ Module 1 — Introduction to R
* ⏳ Module 2 — Statistics
* ⏳ Module 3 — Data Visualization
* ⏳ Module 4 — Machine Learning
* ⏳ Capstone Projects

---

## 💖 **Personal Vision**

This space is where I practice, grow, and document my journey in Data Science — with intention, clarity, and a little bit of magic.
